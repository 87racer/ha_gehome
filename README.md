# Custom Components for Home Assistant

## `sharkiq`
Integration for Shark IQ Robot Vacuums

## `ge_kitchen`
Integration for GE WiFi-enabled kitchen appliances.  Right now, this is largely a proof of concept as HA doesn't yet
have entity types for ovens, refrigerators, etc., but I'm hoping this may provide some motivation to expand the platform
roster.  Currently, I've only really built out ovens.  If anybody who has other GE appliances sees this and wants to
pitch in, please shoot me a message or make a PR.
